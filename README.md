# ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome!

My name is Alina, and Iâ€™m a **web developer in training** (dÃ©veloppeur web en formation) based in France.

**âœ¨ What Iâ€™ve learned so far: âœ¨**

- Solid knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**
- Worked on a **group project** hosted right here on GitHub
- Basic understanding of **UI/UX design**, including creating website mockups (maquettes de site) using **Figma**

**ðŸŒ± Always learning!**

Iâ€™m very curious and eager to keep learning â€” not just during my training, but well beyond. Iâ€™m especially excited to explore more about **JavaScript**, front-end frameworks, and best practices in modern web development.

**ðŸ“« Letâ€™s connect!**

Feel free to check out my projects, and donâ€™t hesitate to connect or reach out!
